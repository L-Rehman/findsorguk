    <h3>Volunteering</h3>
    <p>The Portable Antiquities Scheme supports a network of volunteers across the country. Volunteering for the Scheme
        is a great way to get involved with your local heritage. Our volunteer roles are varied and flexible, and
        include finds identification and recording, finds photography, and public engagement and outreach.</p>
    <p>Volunteering usually takes place alongside your local Finds Liaison Officer (FLO). If you are interested in
        volunteering for the Scheme, please contact your local <a href="/contacts" target="_blank">FLO</a>.</p>

    <h3>Self-recording</h3>
    <p>In 2010, the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) introduced the function for detectorists and others (known as
        ‘self-recorders’) who have been trained to use the PAS database to enter details of their own finds. It is a
        process that takes time and patience, but if you are happy to take on the challenge and would like to begin
        self-recording we would be happy to hear from you.</p>

    <h3>Before you begin</h3>
    <p>Please contact your local FLO to discuss getting set up as self-recorder and whether they have the resources in
        place to support you in this. Please note that the self-recording process involves a lot of PAS staff time and
        training, so is not always possible. Your local FLO’s contact details can be found <a href="/contacts">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Please read our <a href="/volunteerrecording" target="_blank">database recording guidance</a>, available in
        chapters in the left-hand menu and attend any training sessions offered by PAS staff.</p>
    <p>This guide explains how to record suitable finds directly onto the database: even with ‘self-recorders’ there are
        some finds we would rather FLOs record. It provides information on how to describe objects using the correct
        terminology and meeting the recording criteria.</p>
    <p>Further guidance on recording finds including finds guides can be found <a href="/counties/guides/">here</a> and
        on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/portableantiquities">YouTube channel.</a></p>

    <h3>Creating an account for the PAS database</h3>
    <p>If your FLO is able to support you in becoming a self-recorder, you may be asked to create an account on the PAS
        training database first. Your FLO will send you joining details. To create an account on the main database
        please visit <a href="/users/account/register" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>You will need to activate your account and will receive an automated email with the activation code and
        instructions.</p>
    <p>After you have registered on the database, please let your FLO know so that they can give you recording
        rights.</p>

    <h3>The workflow process</h3>
    <p>Once you have finished a record it will need to be checked by your FLO.</p>
    <p>Records will remain red-flagged (on review) and not visible to the public until they have been checked and
        promoted by your FLO.</p>
    <p>Yellow-flagged records (awaiting validation) have been promoted and are visible to the public but may need
        further work in due course; it is important to note the PAS database is an evolving resource so no record is
        ever really ‘finished’ and so can be updated with new information.</p>
    <p>Green-flagged records (published) are those that are as finished as they can be.</p>
    <p>Please do not be offended if we make changes to the records you create, offer you additional advice or training
        or asks you to bring in some of the objects you record so that they can be examined in more detail by an FLO. In
        order for database users to maintain confidence in PAS records, it is essential that they are consistent in
        style and terminology. There are minimum criteria and checks that each record must undertake to reach in order
        to be published. Creating publishable records often requires a second opinion. Even FLOs’ records are checked by
        other PAS staff!</p>
    <p>Please note that the checking process can take some time (even many months) due to the large volumes of material
        being uploaded onto the database by FLOs, volunteers and members of the public so please bear with us. If you
        have concerns talk to your FLO in the first place.</p>

    <h3>Self-Recording and Treasure</h3>
    <p>Please do not record any items of potential Treasure onto the database yourself and instead contact the relevant
        <a href="/contacts" target="_blank">FLO</a> or the Treasure Team at <a href="mailto:treasure@britishmuseum.org">treasure@britishmuseum.org</a>.
        For information on Treasure, please read the guidance
        which can be found <a href="/treasure" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Need help?</h3>
    <p>If you have any questions about using the database please do not hesitate to contact your local <a
                href="/contacts" target="_blank">FLO</a>. If you are having technical problems with the database please
        contact us at <a href="mailto:info@finds.org.uk">info@finds.org.uk</a>.</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking an interest in recording with the Portable Antiquities Scheme.</p>
